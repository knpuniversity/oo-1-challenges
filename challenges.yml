project_startservermc:
  question: How can you start the built-in PHP web server ?
  explanation: |
    The option passed to PHP must be a capital **S** `php -S`, because it stands for *server*,
    a lower case **s** stands for *syntax highlight*.
    Tip: you can run `php --help` to check all possible options.
